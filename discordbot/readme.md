# This discord bot allows you to control your C2 Server through discord commands,
1. /listagents
2. /sendcommand <command> <agentid>
3. /setcheckintime <check_in_time>

This is very a POC and you can do way way better especially in how i handled the queries from the command from the discord channel, this was coded within a span of a few hrs pls dont roast me too hard alot of Bad Coding Practices :D
