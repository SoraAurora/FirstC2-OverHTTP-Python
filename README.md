This is my first C2 Over http protocol.

It has three parts , TeamServer , Handlers and Agents

Handlers send commands to TeamServer and forwards said commands to agent, agent sends data back down the chain and the handlers will get it.

Instructions

1. Run TeamServer
2. Run Handler
3. Run Agents

To kill an agent simply send the command 'kill' to said agents.
